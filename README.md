# About
This is a fork of [yokoffing's filterlists repository](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists) which aims to format a number their filters in a way that supports the latest builds of Adblock Plus.

# Issues 
Metrokoto does not actively offer support for these filters, however, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/Metrokoto/filterlists-abp/issues/new) if you wish to propose a change to any of the filters.

## Disclaimer
By using these filters, you agree that they are experimental, and that Metrokoto is not responsible for any breakage.

Due to the rather archaic filter syntax Adblock Plus has, converting uBlock Origin filters is not a simple process.

**These filters should only be used if you have no other option and are an** ***advanced user***.

**uBlock Origin provides a much more in-depth filter syntax and far superior adblocking capabilities.**
